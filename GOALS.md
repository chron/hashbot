# GOALS

Create a basic Slack bot and learn about Slack's APIs.

Write some Ruby code that doesn't rely on Rails or its ecosystem.

Deploy and debug on Heroku.

The stack:
 * Ruby 2.3.1
 * Sinatra on Puma
 * DataMapper on Postgres
 * The Slack API

# ROADMAP

## Init

[x] Sinatra on Ruby 2.3.1
[x] Basic bot setup, API key
[x] Postgres + DataMapper for persistence
[x] Set up Heroku with Postgres addon
[x] Git repo with .gitignore
[ ] Rspec test suite

## Challenges

[x] Start a new code golf challenge
[x] Announce to channel
[ ] Challenge end.  Maybe start and end dates?

## Submissions

[x] Submit to the bot via channel or DM
[ ] Evaluate code in a safe-ish way
[x] Get a useful response message
[x] Error handling for syntax problems etc
[x] Announce in the channel when we have a new leader

## Reporting

[x] View info about the current challenge
[x] Get details of my best submission
[x] See a leaderboard

## Stretch Goals

[ ] i18n messages
[ ] Other challenge types (quickest, most performant, etc.)
[ ] Sexy date format (distance_of_time_in_words etc)
[ ] Capture name changes faster (currently only on submission)
